# introduction
Self intro, what are the tools and technologies you have worked on and what are your roles and responsibilities are?

# Api autimation
in rest assured,  how you perform serialization and deserialization apart from POJO, what approaches you are aware?

API mocking, stubbing. How we can perform it?

Can you tell me like difference between Jason path and Jason object when to use Jason path when to Jason object?

Authentications, Have you worked with auth one or two? You know when to use auth one? When to use auth 2?

What are the design patterns you got chance to work on API automation.
Explain singleton decorator builder this you got chance to explore? So suppose I have a class with me, how we can convert any class to Singleton,
What are the steps we need to follow?

Can you tell me functional difference between page object model and page factory?


# CICD 
how much exposure  you have 
how we can provide multiple parameter to the jenkins job?
suppose you join any project and there is a requirement for CICD integration like as soon as developer push their code, our automation pipeline should trigger automatically.
How we can configure this thing?
Have you worked with Sonar Cube anytime, What are the quality gates there like that?

# STLC / SDLC
as per your experience, you got chance to contribute on test strategy, test plan creation?
What's the thing we will add in test strategy document which are not there in test plan?

in agile what are the story estimation approaches you are aware?
There are 5-6 approaches in agile, Can you name for story estimation approaches?

test pyramid approach?

suppose you join any project as a lead or senior guy,  and client ask you to share some metrics.
So what client specific metrics you will share like as per your experience only client specific metrics, can you name few of them, Can you name for quality metrics?

# programs
list of string "bad, cat, dog, Apple" and all and we need to group them as per their length.?

#Java
Difference between different colletions like hashmap vs treemap

#  Framework 
you work with testNg ,BDD ?
parallel execution?
Scenario context?
testng listeners?
How to implement log 4 J?
clean code principles ?
web automation like how you work with remote executions like integration with browser stack, Selenium grid.


# version control 
what is the use of rebase and merge command?
What approach you follow for conflict resolution?

# AI
And any AI tool you started exploring that you are aware that you are using in your SDLC process in a real time experience
